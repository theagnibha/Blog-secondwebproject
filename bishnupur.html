            <h3>Bishnupur- Land of Temples</h3>
            <small>April 29,2019</small>
            <p>
              Bishnupur a tiny hamlet in the Bankura district of West Bengal.
              This place is well known among tourists and a visit here will
              definitely leave anyone awestruck.
            </p>
            <h1>Brief History of Bishnupur</h1>
            <p>
              This place is the terracotta marvel of India. Beautiful majestic
              temples comprising of intricate designs are made from baked clay
              and stands testimony to the fact that there is much more in India
              unexplored and unknown. Bishnupur has a lot of terracotta temples
              and each one is a marvel in its own way since you don't want to
              miss any of the temples, you should take a guide from the Govt.
              guest house in Bishnupur. It is always a good idea to hire a guide
              since the guides are knowledgeable and can tell you the history
              and the anecdotes associated with each temple.
            </p>
            <h1>How would you go there?</h1>
            <p>
              Bishnupur is easily accessible by road from Kolkata(Just 132km).
              Express or Local Trains like Rupashi Bangla Express, Aranyak
              Express, and Purulia Express are also available from Howrah
              Station. It will take 3.30 to 4.15 hours to reach Bishnupur via
              Kharagpur and Medinipur.
            </p>
            <h1>5 Major places to visit</h1>
            <ul>
              <li>Rasmancha</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You have to buy your tickets from the ticket counter at Rasmancha.
              As far I can remember per person ticket charge was INR 5 and
              photography was free of any charges. You need to preserve this
              ticket to gain entry to all the terracotta temples monitored by
              ASI. Rasmancha is a beautiful structure with lateral arches
              supported by pillars. The base of the structure rests on a raised
              late-rite platform. Established in 1600 AD by the Malla King
              Hambhir, in the earlier era during the Vaisnava Ras festival, all
              the Radha Krishna idols of Bishnupur town used to be brought here
              and worshipped.

            </caption>
            <p>
              The interesting thing about the temple is that it has only a
              single chamber, the sanctum sanctorum, with an elongated tower,
              surrounded by hut-shaped turrets. A passageway surrounds it and
              some large cannons found here date back to the Malla period. Words
              will fall short in describing the utter beauty and class of this
              terracotta masterpiece.

              <li>Madan Mohan Temple</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              One of the beautiful temples is Madan Mohan temple and it is still
              functional though it also falls under ASI Protection. This temple
              is built on the "ekratna"(meaning single pinnacle)style. The roof
              is flat rectangular with lightly pressed corners giving it the
              typical Bengal thatched roof style. On the roof is a single
              pinnacle and hence the ekaratna style of architecture. This temple
              has intricate stories of Puranas and Ramayanas beautifully
              inscribed on the terracotta tablets. One should take plenty of
              time to marvel at this wonderful "Jugalbaandhi" of stone and
              terracotta. Opposite to the Madan Mohan temple is another
              elongated terracotta structure. It currently houses the temple
              kitchen.

            </ul>
            <p>
              "Jor Bangla" (jointed) temple. As the name suggests the structure
              of the temple looks like as if two huts are joined together. And
              that's the beauty of it. Personally, for me, I liked it the most
              out of all the Bishnupur temples. the temple facing south is
              raised on a square platform in the form of a pair of hut shaped
              structures with sloping roofs joined together and surmounted by
              charcoal on the top.

            <p>
              Both the interior and exterior walls and ceiling of the temple
              depict exquisite and elaborate terracotta ornamentation. These
              terracotta panels narrate scenes from the epics, Krishna-Lila,
              hunting scenes, various other depictions of contemporary social
              life.

            <p>
              Just next to the Jor Bangla temple is the Radhashyam Temple. This
              Ek-Ratna (single pinnacled) temple is built of laterite stone and
              contains limestone stucco decoration. The temple is enclosed with
              high walls and its entrance consists of a triple-domed Islamic
              style gateway. The temple dating back to 1758 was constructed by
              the Malla King Chaitanya Singh. This temple has an interesting of
              a "tulsi Mancha" which is basically a raised structure, on which
              tulsi plant is planted and worshiped by Hindus.

              Another very beautiful temple known as the "Panch-Ratna temple"
              (meaning five jewel temple, where each pinnacle of the temple
              represents a jewel). This temple is also popularly called the
              Temple of Shyam Rai, named after the ruler who built this temple.
              Approached by the triple arched entrance on all the four sides,
              the Shyamrai temple contains terracotta on all its four sides
              including inner walls and the pinnacles. The Ras chakra and
              lovemaking scenes of Radha Krishna are the most sorts after
              terracotta panels of the Shyamrai Temple.

              One should also visit the Bishnupur Museum, which houses
              interesting artifacts and some award-winning terracotta structures
              made by the experienced artisans. Since photography was not
              allowed inside so you have to simply feast your eyes happily on
              them. Bishnupur is not a place that can be well covered in a day.
              One must soak oneself at least for a day in the wonderfully
              amazing terracotta architecture. It really sad that a lot many
              temples have fallen prey to the vagaries of time and are in ruins.
              Thankfully, the government and ASI have taken notice of this
              wonderful heritage and are now trying to save as much possible.
              Terracotta temples found in Bishnupur are one of a type and only
              found in this tiny part of the world. We are on a very thin
              string, if we lose these temples we will lose a big part of
              architecture and heritage that can never be recreated again.
