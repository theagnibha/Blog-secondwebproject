            <h3>Satyajit Ray- The Genius</h3>
            <small>May 06,2020</small>
            <p>"Simplicity is the Greatest sophistication"</p>
            <p>And Satyajit Ray Resonates this philosophy by Da Vinchi.</p>
            I was introduced to Rayvery early in life with characters like
            Feluda, Anathbabu, Tarinikhuro, Bankubabu and of course Prof.
            Shanku. Each story had their own way to amaze me astound me. He was
            way more ahead of his time. The Pride of all of us. The little
            details he put on his stories, may look simple but actually were
            steeped in subtexts, deeper meanings and universal messaging. "The
            Alien" a film that Ray wants to create, but somehow it wasn't made
            anymore. Apparently after couple of years Stephen spielberg made
            "ET" with the same concept Ray came with. As i said Ray was way more
            ahead of his time. However my understanding of Ray's genius stayed
            limited to his children's films like Sonar kella, Hirak rajar dese.
            I was in my late twenties when I first began watching Ray's work and
            started the journey with a short film called "Two" on YouTube. And
            later Explores some of his genius. I've been writing stories and in
            my writing i try to imbibe Ray's approach of being simple.
            Remembering our legend, Inspiration for so many on his 99th Birth
            Anniversary.
